                   by Reuben Thomas (rrt@sc3d.org)


This package contains the design and implementation of Mite, a simple
general-purpose virtual machine. See {mite,iface,mit}.pdf for documentation.

The URL for the primary distribution is http://mite.sourceforge.net/.


License

Mite is distributed under the BSD license; see the file LICENSE.


Quick start and extras

FIXME: Add pointers to sources of all the tools

Mite should work on almost any ISO C system (see the docs for the small
print). To build it you need a POSIX environment with a C99 compiler, gperf,
Lua 5.3 (http://www.lua.org/ ), and lua-stdlib
(https://github.com/rrthomas/lua-stdlib/ ), most easily installed using
LuaRocks (http://www.luarocks.org ), a LaTeX system (including latexmk), and
HeVeA. To build from a source release:

./configure && make

The design is described in mite.tex; the API is in iface.tex.


Bugs

Bug reports, especially of systems on which Mite doesn't work when it
should, are welcome. Please use the bug-tracker at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mite/.
