This package contains the design and implementation of Mite, a simple
general-purpose virtual machine. See {mite,iface,mit}.pdf for documentation.

The URL for the primary distribution is http://mite.sourceforge.net/.


License

Mite is distributed under the BSD license; see the file LICENSE.


Quick start and extras

Mite should work on almost any ISO C system (see the docs for the
small print). A Makefile is provided. "make all" makes mit, the Mite
translator; you should check the Makefile first.

The design is described in mite.tex; the API is in iface.tex.


Bugs

Bug reports, especially of systems on which Mite doesn't work when it
should, are welcome. Please use the bug-tracker at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mite/.
