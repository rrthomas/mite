                            --------------

                   by Reuben Thomas (rrt@sc3d.org)


This package contains the design and implementation of Mite 2, a simple
general-purpose virtual machine. See {mite,iface,mit}.pdf for documentation.

The URL for the primary distribution is http://sc3d.org/rrt/


License

Mite is distributed under a BSD-like license, included in the file LICENSE.


Quick start and extras

Mite should work on almost any ISO 99 *or* ANSI 89 C system (see the docs
for the small print). A Makefile is provided. "make all" makes mit, the Mite
translator; you should check the Makefile first.

The design is described in mite.tex; the API is in iface.w and the
implementation in mit.w. The .w files are nuweb files; nuweb is also
available from the URL above, or from http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/. Some
custom LaTeX packages are used in the documentation, which are available in
my LaTeX package collection from the URL above.


Bugs

Bug reports, especially of systems on which Mite doesn't work when it
should, are welcome. There are no known bugs.
